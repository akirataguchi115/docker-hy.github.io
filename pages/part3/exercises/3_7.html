  <h1>3.6: Multi-stage backend</h1>
  Lets do a multi-stage build for the [backend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-backend) project since we've come so far with the application.

  The project is in golang and building a binary that runs in a container, while straightforward, isn't exactly trivial. Use resources that you have available (Google, example projects) to build the binary and run it inside a container that uses FROM scratch.

  To pass the exercise the image must be smaller than <b>25MB</b>.
  
  Tip: When you're googling Docker's error messages you might want to [filter search results](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=675274&seqNum=3). F.ex. to exclude the word 'Windows' from your search results you could type
  ```
  error_blah_blah_thats_probably_linux_problem -windows
  ```
